#This is a file to note a few things about installing cmake and addind it to path etx (which was required for hmmcopy_utils)

1) Cmake can be installed in two ways: i) source distribution ii) binary distribution (binary meaning it is already compiled)
   This can be found on the cmake website : https://cmake.org/download/ (I USED THE TAR.GZ VERSION)

2) Once you have downloaded the tar.gz version - unpack it using: tar -xvf blah.tar.gz

3) Then we need to add the path of cmake to our ~/.bashrc script (if you are using bash!) in order that we can execute cmake from any dir
   This can be done by:
   i) nano ~/.bashrc

   ii) Then add the following line:
       export PATH=/path/to-cmake/bin:$PATH

4) Then close all terminals and open. Veryify that this has been done correctley by: which cmake (this should return the dir where you installed cmake)
